# 📊 Loan Default Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is about exploring a **loan default dataset using Python** to understand
why some borrowers default on loans and what factors increase risk.

The main purpose of this project is to practice **EDA thinking** and learn how data
can be used to identify risk patterns before building any predictive model.

## 📌 Why I did this project

In finance-related analytics roles, understanding **borrower risk** is very important.
Instead of directly applying machine learning, I wanted to first understand the data:

- What kind of borrowers default more?
- Which features show strong risk signals?
- How different variables behave together?

This project helped me practice asking the **right questions from data**.

## 🧠 What I did in this analysis

In this project, I worked on:
- cleaning raw loan data
- handling missing and incorrect values
- performing univariate analysis to understand individual features
- performing bivariate analysis to see relationships with loan default
- checking correlations between numeric variables
- identifying borrower segments with higher default risk

The focus was on **understanding patterns**, not just plotting graphs.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Key Observations

- Certain income-related and credit-related features show strong relationship with default
- Some borrower groups have noticeably higher default rates
- Combining multiple factors gives better risk understanding than looking at one feature alone

## ✅ What I learned

- How to approach EDA in a structured way
- How to think from a **risk analysis** point of view
- Why EDA is critical before any modeling step
- How data patterns can support business decisions

---

## 🔮 What I plan to do next

- Build a basic predictive model using this dataset
- Compare model results with EDA insights
- Add feature engineering based on observed patterns
